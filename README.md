My process

Built with:

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Mobile-first workflow
Vanilla JavaScript
What I learned

The new thing I had learned was how to style radio buttons.

I got to practice setting up a form, using JavaScript to add a CSS class with the Element.classList property, as well as making a web page interactive through JavaScript's addEventListener() method. The change event in particular is useful to update and register the input value.

I learned more about designing accessible web pages, such as using the aria-live attribute and the :focus-visible pseudo-class.

I learned to practice the habit of using console.log() to check if my JavaScript functions are working as intended, amd cheking the console output in my web browser's developer tool.

Continued development

I aim to practice making my web pages accessible and my JavaScript skills more to make web pages interactive.
